 We're going to use BANANAS to stop and start songs. Different bananas will play different songs.
 If you haven't used the Makey Makey before, check out this guide before you start: http://makeymakey.com/howto.php
 
 1. Download a song from YouTube using: youtube-mp3.org
 2. Plug the Makey Makey into the bananas.
 3. Finish the Processing code below so that touching a banana will start and stop a song.
